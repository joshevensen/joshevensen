title: "My Journey with Angular, Vue, and React"
excerpt: "Over the years I've used the top three JS frameworks and even a few others and I thought I 'd share my opinion and experience of each one."

## Vue at the beginning

My first step from building websites and getting into software was with Laravel. So it was natural to also start with Vue.

## A short time with Angular

In 2018 I started working at a company that used Angular as their frontend framework of choice. So of course I learned about Angular.

I both liked and disliked the complexity of the Angular architecture.

## Resistance to React

Within about a year we had to restart a major project and explored what frontend framework to use. In the end we went with Vue because we chose Laravel for the backend.

I was reluctant to use React because I'm not a fan of Facebook and their move fast and break things mentality. Plus I'm not a fan of social media to begin with. I also didn't want to give JSX a chance. Instead I wanted to stick with what I knew.

## Introduction to ReactNative

At work I was asked to build my first mobile app and the decision was made to go with the Ionic Framework. I wasn't much of a fan of working with Ionic Framework and Vue. There aren't a lot of examples and tutorials for the Vue version. Most of the examples and tutorials were for Angular which makes senes.

I completed the app in Ionic because that was the business decision, but personally I decided to give ReactNative a try due to it's popularity. So I bought a tutorial from my one of my favorite teachers Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and went about building an app.

## New Love of React and Next.js

Learn ReactNative got me excited about software again and specifically about React. I found that I really liked the way React works and I finally saw why everyone loves it so much. Now I'm enjoying building this new personal website with Next.js.
